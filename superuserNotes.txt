Make superuser account
    -run "python manage.py createsuperuser"
    -enter username, dummy email, password

Manually adding patient users to the database
    Go to Patients link -> click grey + add button (top right) -> green + to add new username/pw combination ->
        enter + hit save in popup window (inserts into database) -> go to the Home link (top left) -> click on new
        user in list of recent actions -> enter name + email -> save
    NOTE: by default, email is left blank (which can't be done twice bc then they would match), so you have
         to update the email of the first user before making another one

Go into workbench + update confirmation flag manually
    use treeohealthdb;
    UPDATE users_acc_user SET is_email_confirmed=1 WHERE username = "first_user";

(Now you should be able to use the user as if they verified their external email)
