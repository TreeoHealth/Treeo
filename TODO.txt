Low level
-how to link foreign key objects that already exist in the db
-how to correctly use forms.py to collect a dr note from the view

-MAKE a low level set of users (2 of each type), appts, and archive appts so if you have to drop and remake, you
    don't lose all functionality that relies on having items in the db

Dr notes
-model -> appt #, provider, patient, 1000 word limit, time stamp, original note flag
-encrypt all dr notes
-button on archived appt list to show dr notees page
-make interface for dr to write notes
-make button to save 1st note 
    -"are you sure you want to save this note? you will not be able to change it"
    -automatically save ? min after appt ends (give them time to edit)??
-make button for dr on appt>dr notes page ("append") -> makes a new model obj
-make readonly display for patients to read in time order (mark orig vs edits)
    -make same display for dr but w button
-make button for "make appt notes" next to appt that they can't do until 10 min before appt starts

General TODO
-make "share w provider" button so all docs have a level of protection from assigned providers
-dr sign up link -> admin gen
-limit admin access (only provider uploads)
    -make a "share w treeo admin" button
-fully encryption of wellness/msging
